The original data set has 14 columns as follows. Age: Age of the patient Sex: Sex of the patient exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) ca: number of major vessels (0-3) cp: Chest Pain type chest pain type Value 1: typical angina Value 2: atypical angina Value 3: non-anginal pain Value 4: asymptomatic trtbps : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg) chol: cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor fbs : (fasting blood sugar &gt; 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false) rest_ecg: resting electrocardiographic results Value 0: normal Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of &gt; 0.05 mV) Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes’ criteria thalach: maximum heart rate achieved target: 0 = less chance of heart attack 1 = more chance of heart attack The goal of this project is to predict the probability of whether a person is likely to have a heart attack based on their gender, age, cholesterol level using a logistic model, a Naive Bayes model, a Neural Network model, and a decision tree model. In addition, I will compare the result of all three models with the ‘target’ variable, which is the prediction of heart attack provided by the data author.
