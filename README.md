### Description	

For this project, I will examine the Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset. The original data set has 14 columns.

The goal of this project is to predict the probability of whether a person is likely to have a heart attack based on their gender, age, cholesterol level using a logistic model, a Naive Bayes model, a Neural Network model and a decision tree model. In addition, I will compare the result of all three models with the ‘target’ variable, which is the prediction of heart attack provided by the data author.
