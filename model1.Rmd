# Linear Model

Linear models are commonly employed in machine learning and statistical analysis due to their simplicity. In a linear model, the relationship between variables is assumed to be linear, indicating that the dependent variable's change is proportional to the independent variable's change. Following this, a linear model was constructed using the training dataset, and its performance was evaluated using the test dataset.

```{r}
lm.model <- lm(HeartDisease ~ ., data = train_data)
summary(lm.model)

lm.prediction <- predict(lm.model, newdata = test_data, type = "response")
lm.prediction <- ifelse(lm.prediction >= 0.5, 1, 0)

table(test_data$HeartDisease, lm.prediction)
sum(test_data$HeartDisease==lm.prediction) / nrow(test_data)
```
The accuracy rate is 89.61749%.
