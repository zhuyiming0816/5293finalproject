Linear models: 89.61749%
Logistic Regression Model : 88.52459%
Random Forest Model : 86.88525%


Based on the model accuracy results provided, it appears that the linear model has the highest accuracy with 89.61749%. This suggests that the linear model may be the best fit for the data and could potentially provide the most accurate predictions. However, it's important to consider other factors such as interpretability and complexity of the model.

The logistic regression model has an accuracy of 88.52459%, which is only slightly lower than the linear model. This suggests that logistic regression may also be a good fit for the data and could be a simpler model than the linear model, which could be an advantage in some cases.

The random forest model has the lowest accuracy of the three models with 86.88525%. While it may not be the best fit for this particular dataset, it's important to note that random forest models can often be effective for more complex datasets with non-linear relationships.

Overall, it's important to consider the specific context and goals of the analysis when selecting a model. While accuracy is an important metric, it should not be the only factor considered. Other factors such as interpretability, complexity, and scalability should also be taken into account when selecting the best model for a particular problem.
