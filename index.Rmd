# Proposal

For this project, I will examine the Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset. The original data set has 14 columns as follows. 

Age: Age of the patient

Sex: Sex of the patient

exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

ca: number of major vessels (0-3)

cp: Chest Pain type chest pain type

Value 1: typical angina
Value 2: atypical angina
Value 3: non-anginal pain
Value 4: asymptomatic
trtbps : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)

chol: cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor

fbs : (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

rest_ecg: resting electrocardiographic results

Value 0: normal
Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria

thalach: maximum heart rate achieved

target: 
0 = less chance of heart attack 
1 = more chance of heart attack

The goal of this project is to predict the probability of whether a person is likely to have a heart attack based on their gender, age, cholesterol level using a logistic model, a Naive Bayes model, a Neural Network model, and a decision tree model. In addition, I will compare the result of all three models with the ‘target’ variable, which is the prediction of heart attack provided by the data author.  

This repo was initially generated from a bookdown template available here: https://github.com/jtr13/IMLVtemplate.
