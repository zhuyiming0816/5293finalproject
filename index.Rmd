# Proposal
With 17.9 million deaths per year, or 31% of all deaths worldwide, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Heart attacks and strokes account for four out of every five CVD fatalities, and one-third of these deaths happen before the age of 70. Heart failure is a frequent complication of CVDs, and this dataset comprises 11 variables that might be used to anticipate the development of a potential heart condition.

A machine learning model can be very helpful in the early diagnosis and care of people with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, or previously existing illness).

For this project, I will examine the Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset. The original data set has 14 columns as follows. 

Age: Age of the patient

Sex: Sex of the patient

exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

ca: number of major vessels (0-3)

cp: Chest Pain type chest pain type

Value 1: typical angina
Value 2: atypical angina
Value 3: non-anginal pain
Value 4: asymptomatic
trtbps : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)

chol: cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor

fbs : (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

rest_ecg: resting electrocardiographic results

Value 0: normal
Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria

oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

h: 
0 = less chance of heart attack 
1 = more chance of heart attack

The goal of this project is to predict the probability of whether a person is likely to have a heart attack based on their gender, age, cholesterol level using a linear model as the baseline model, a logistic model, and a Nrandom forest model. In addition, I will compare the result of all three models with the ‘target’ variable, which is the prediction of heart attack provided by the data author.
